Note: There's two manuals in PDF, you can see those for more in-depth information.

A Java-based compiler implementation featuring lexical and syntactic analysis with integrated mathematical processing capabilities. This academic project demonstrates compiler construction principles while providing practical functionality for code analysis.
Features

Lexical Analysis: Supports 12 distinct token types with enhanced operator recognition (++, --, **)
Syntax Validation: Real-time error detection with line-specific feedback
Mathematical Processing: Integrated quadratic equation solver with step-by-step calculation display
Variable Management: Efficient tracking and validation of numeric variables
GUI Interface: User-friendly interface with real-time analysis feedback

Technical Requirements

Java JDK 21.0.1
Apache NetBeans IDE 19
Minimum 4GB RAM
Windows 7 or higher

Installation

Clone the repository
Open the project in Apache NetBeans IDE
Build and run the project

Usage

Input your Java code in the text area
Click "Analyze" to perform lexical and syntactic analysis
View results in the output area
For quadratic equations, use the formulaGeneral(a, b, c) method

Example
javaCopyint a = 2;
int b = 3;
int c = 1;
formulaGeneral(a, b, c);
